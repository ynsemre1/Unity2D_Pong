- Basic AI for single-player mode.
- Simple controls: players can move their paddles up and down to hit the ball.
- Classic retro-style graphics and sound effects for a nostalgic experience.

## How to Play

2. In two-player mode, Player 1 controls the left paddle using the W and S keys, while Player 2 controls the right paddle using the Up and Down arrow keys.
3. In single-player mode, control the left paddle using the W and S keys, while the right paddle is controlled by the computer.
4. Hit the ball with your paddle to keep it in play and try to score points by getting it past your opponent's paddle.
